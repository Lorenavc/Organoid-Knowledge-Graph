# Organoid-Knowledge-Graph

Organoid Knowledge Graph (Organoid KG) was created in the neo4j database and emcompasses 147 human organoid multiomics datasets from Array Express; it includes nodes such as organoid type, source of organoid, assay method, perturbagen applied, and main organoid growth protocol(s) used. Additionally, we integrated our organoid knowledge graph with PrimeKG, a biomedical knowledge graph, to make the combined resource more comprehensive and to showcase the versatility of a graph structure.
